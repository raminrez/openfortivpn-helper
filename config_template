# OpenFortiVPN Configuration Template
# Copy this file to ~/.config/openfortivpn/config and customize it for your VPN
# NOTE: This project uses interactive foreground connections only. You will be
# prompted for passwords and one-time passwords (OTP) in your terminal when
# running `vpn start`.

# Minimal configuration (required)
# Replace values with your VPN server details.
host = your-vpn-server.com
port = 443
username = your-username

# Optional: leave password commented out to be prompted interactively
# WARNING: storing passwords in plain text is not recommended
# password = your-password

# Optional: pin the server certificate for security (recommended)
# Get the hash with: openfortivpn your-vpn-server.com:443 --check-cert
# trusted-cert = sha256:your_certificate_hash_here

# Optional: DNS servers to use while connected (one per line)
# dns = 8.8.8.8
# dns = 8.8.4.4

# Optional: additional routes to add when the tunnel is up
# route = 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0
# route = 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0

# Security notes:
# - Keep this file readable only by your user (installer sets 600 permissions).
# - Prefer leaving the password out and entering it interactively.
# - Use trusted-cert to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.

# Example:
# host = vpn.company.com
# port = 443
# username = alice
# trusted-cert = sha256:abcd1234...
# dns = 8.8.8.8
